OOP:
1. Create more packets.
2. Add multiple worlds - up to five or ten.
3. Add multiple languages.
4. Add javadocs.
5. Make Google Translate be used throughout the whole server.
6. Transfer Google Translate over to the client.
7. A performance/OOP distribution for preference of others.

Performance:
2. Methods and fields should become final and/or static.
3. Use large classes, not small ones.
4. Avoid interfaces and abstract classes - avoid OOP.
5. Create large methods instead of smaller one.
6. Avoid synchronization.
7. Avoid creating lots of short-lived Objects.
8. Use smaller primitive data types when possible.
9. Use a boolean if an int value is 0 or 1.
